The China Historical Christian Database (CHCD) quantifies and visualizes the place of Christianity in modern China (1550-1950). It provides users the tools to discover where Christian churches, schools, hospital, orphanages, publishing houses, and the like were located in China, and it documents who worked inside those buildings, both foreign and Chinese.

The CHCD is hosted by the Center for Global Christianity and Mission at Boston University.
The data that makes up the CHCD is distributed under a [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license. This means your are free to use, share, and adapt the data as long as correct attribution is given.
